# LangChani_QA_Project:

This project delves into the potential of machine learning to answer questions posed in natural language about Langchain, a blockchain-based knowledge graph. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to:
 * Develop a robust machine learning model: This model will be trained to effectively answer questions about Langchain data, enabling users to retrieve information through natural language queries.
 * Evaluate the model's performance: The project will employ a benchmark dataset to assess the model's accuracy and efficiency in answering questions.
 * Refine and enhance the model: By analyzing the results obtained from the evaluation, the project will identify areas for improvement, leading to further refinement and enhancement of the model's capabilities.
Getting Started
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:
 * Clone the repository: This will create a local copy of the project files on your machine.
 * Install dependencies: The project requires specific Python libraries to function. You'll find a list of these dependencies in the requirements.txt file. Use a package manager like pip to install them.
 * Run the training script: The script named train.py is responsible for training the machine learning model. Execute this script to commence the training process.
 * Evaluate the model: Once training is complete, you can assess the model's performance using the script named evaluate.py. This script will test the model's accuracy on a designated test dataset.
Dependencies
The project relies on several Python libraries, including:
 * A deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch
 * NumPy for numerical computations
 * Pandas for data manipulation
